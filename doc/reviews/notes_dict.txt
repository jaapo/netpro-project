No good description about why the central server accepts a node or not.
Why is the range only by first letter, doesn't really scale eh?
Data file format is inflexible, does require full rewrite on updates and scan on reads :o
Error handling, what happens if read EOF, socket closed, invalid response, etc
Where is the data read from?
"Will keep polling the user for commands"
command line commands are ambiguos, what about spaces in terms or descriptions
what happens after a server retrieves information of another server node. protocol description isn't adequate.
"operations ... are protected by a file lock" how? what file is locked
logging
data file descriptions (names and locations)
TCP connections. are they kept open all the time or what.
