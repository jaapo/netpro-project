\section{Short summary of the project}
Distributed storage for terms and their descrptions. Data is distributed to multiple servers, all of which have same ability to provide service to users. Architecture is three-tier. A centralized server stores information about term server's addresses and their term ranges.
Every client communicates with their designated term server. Term server transparently finds out the term description from other servers, if server's own range doesn't contain the term.
Term servers query the centralized server to find other term servers to fulfill client requests.
